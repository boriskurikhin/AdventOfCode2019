# AdventOfCode2019

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

My solutions to the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019). All solutions are original, and are written in the Java programming language.
